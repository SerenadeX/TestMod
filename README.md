# TestMod

Generic name right?  I'm learning how to write a mod for Minecraft!  So this is my basic project.  Not everything is committed, just the code I am working on.  If you want to get the whole set of files you will have to clone this repo and then download the source files from [MinecraftForge](http://files.minecraftforge.net).
